# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This is a prework study guide that I as a bootcamp student can return to it whenever I please.I can use it to help me study and use it as a building block so that once I learn something new I can add to it  and keep building off of it and using it to help me better understand what I am learning. I learned how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a cooperative manner to set up a simple web page.
